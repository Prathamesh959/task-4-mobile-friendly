# Task 4 – Make Website Mobile-Friendly Using Media Queries

##  What I Did
I created a simple website and made it responsive using CSS media queries. The layout changes automatically when viewed on mobile devices (screen width less than 768px).

##  Steps I Followed
1. Created `index.html` and `style.css` files.
2. Added a navigation bar and two content columns in the layout.
3. Used the `<meta name="viewport">` tag to enable responsive scaling.
4. Wrote a media query with `max-width: 768px` to:
   - Stack the navbar and columns vertically
   - Reduce font size
   - Make the layout mobile-friendly
5. Tested the design using Chrome DevTools (Device Toolbar).

##  What I Learned
- How to use `@media` queries in CSS
- The importance of the viewport meta tag
- Flexbox helps in making responsive layouts
- How to test responsiveness on different screen sizes

##  Tools Used

## Files Included

##  Output
